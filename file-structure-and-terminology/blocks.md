# Blocks

Blocks are the independent units within a Preset, they are the building blocks (pun intended) of tone. Blocks represent inputs and outputs of a signal, effect pedals, amps, preamps, cabs, and sends/returns, as well as more advanced audio manipulations like impulse responses and loopers.&#x20;

Every Block has a set of editable settings called "parameters" such as the Drive of a distortion pedal or the Sweep of a flanger.&#x20;

Blocks come in three main types:

### Input Blocks

Each Path in a Preset begins with one or two Input Blocks which defines where the input signal to the path comes from. In most cases this will be set to Guitar to use the 1/4" input jack.

Input Blocks have adjustable parameters such as an input gate with threshold and decay settings.

### Output Blocks

Each Path ends in one or two Output Blocks which defines where the output signal is sent. The default "Multi" Output Block outputs to the 1/4", XLR, Digital, and USB 1/2 output jacks simultaneously and is usually the best choice.

Path 1 is able to use the Path 2 Output Blocks to send it's output signal to the input of Path 2, essentially giving you more space to cramp effect Blocks into.

Output Blocks have adjustable parameters to control the Pan and Level of the output signal, useful for bringing a relatively quiet Preset up to the same volume as your other Presets so the sound engineer doesn't need to adjust your gain when you switch Presets.

### Effect Blocks

The number of Effect Blocks in the Space Shuttle is staggering, and almost all of them are based on real-world effects pedals from a variety of manufacturers.

Effect Blocks are organized into 10 categories:

| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png>) Distortion | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (15).png>) Reverb      |
| --------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png>) Dynamics   | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png>) Pitch/Synth |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png>) EQ         | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (17).png>) Filter      |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (13).png>) Modulation | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (18).png>) Wah         |
| ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png>) Delay      | ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png>) Volume/Pan  |

### Amp+Cab Blocks

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (20).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (21).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (22).png>)![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png>)

Amps, Cabs, and Amp+Cab combos are all available as Blocks. For each Amp model there is also a corresponding Preamp model if you are feeding the output of the Space Shuttle to an external amplifier for some reason.

### Additional Blocks

#### ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (24).png>) Impulse Responses

IRs are mathematical functions representing actual acoustic measurements of a specific system and can be downloaded and installed to add new Blocks to the system.

#### ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (25).png>)Sends/Returns

A Send Block routes the signal to one of the Send jacks on the rear panel, for example to insert a physical effect pedal into the signal path of your Preset.

The corresponding Return Block captures the incoming signal from the Return jack on the rear panel.

#### ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png>)Looper

The Space Shuttle has 3 built-in Looper models in both Mono and Stereo. When in Stomp Mode (see [modes.md](../user-interface/modes.md "mention")), pressing the footswitch assigned to a Looper Block will activate Looper Mode, allowing you to control the looper using the footswitches. See [views.md](../user-interface/views.md "mention") for how to put the screen in Performance Mode in order to see what each footswitch does in this Mode.

#### Split and Merge

A Split Block splits a Path into two parallel paths, which are merged back together with a Merge Block.&#x20;
