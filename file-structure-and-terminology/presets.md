# Presets

If Setlists are like folders, Presets are the files. Each Preset represents a complete configuration of Inputs, Outputs, and all the amps, effects, filters, etc. in between, as well as any footswitch and expression pedal assignments.

Here is an example of a Preset:

This Preset, Happy Trails, is number 07A in it's Setlist (more on the A, B, C, and D in Preset numbers in [banks.md](banks.md "mention")). In the center of the screen we can see the Signal Path which contains a number of [blocks.md](blocks.md "mention") representing:

* the Input to the path (Guitar in this case)
* some effect Blocks (Filter, Distorion, Delay, and Reverb)
* an Amp+Cab Block
* the Output of the path (the back panel jacks in this case)

Each Preset also stores 8 Snapshots, essentially 8 different versions of the same configuration of Blocks. See [snapshots.md](snapshots.md "mention") and [working-with-snapshots.md](../working-with-presets/working-with-snapshots.md "mention") for more information.
