# Setlists

A Setlist is just a folder of Presets. The Space Shuttle stores 8 setlists which each contain 128 Presets for a total of 1024 Presets.

To see the list of Setlists, click the PRESET knob:

The 2 **Factory** Setlists store all of the pre-build Presets, the 5 **User** Setlists are for musicians to save their edited or from-scratch Presets, and the **Templates** Setlist provides some good starting points for building new Presets from Scratch.

In general, try to to overwrite Presets in the **Factory** or **Templates** Setlists.

We will likely rename the **User** Setlists to allocate one each to the primary users of the Space Shuttle
