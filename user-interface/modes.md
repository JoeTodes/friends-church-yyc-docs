# Modes

What each footswitch does depends on which of 4 Modes the Space Shuttle is in. Use the HOME button to toggle to Performance View if not already in it to see what each footswitch is currently mapped to (see [views.md](views.md "mention")).

### Preset Mode

The MODE footswitch toggles between Preset Mode and Stomp Mode

In Preset Mode, the 8 central footswitches are used to select a Preset within the current Setlist (see [Broken link](broken-reference "mention")).&#x20;

The two footswitches on the left (labelled ^ and v) are used to scroll through the list of Presets in the Setlist

### Stomp Mode

The MODE footswitch toggles between Preset Mode and Stomp Mode

In Stomp Mode, the 8 central footswitches turn on/off any Blocks assigned to them.

While in Stomp Mode, pressing one of the two footswitches on the left (labelled ^ and v) temporarily enters Preset Mode until a Preset is selected.

### Snapshot Mode

Press both left footswitches (labelled ^ and v) simultaneously to enter Snapshot Mode

In Snapshot Mode, the 8 central footswitches are used to select a Snapshot of the current Preset (see [snapshots.md](../file-structure-and-terminology/snapshots.md "mention"))

### Pedal Edit Mode

Hold the MODE footswitch down for 2 seconds to enter Pedal Edit Mode

Pedal Edit Mode allows you to edit most Block's parameters with just the footswitches. The first screen allows you to select a Block to edit by pressing the corresponding central footswitch.&#x20;

The next screen uses the top row of footswitches (including ^ and MODE) to select a parameter, and the bottom row (including v and TAP) for navigation and to adjust the value of the selected parameter. You can also use the Expression Pedal to adjust the selected parameter.
