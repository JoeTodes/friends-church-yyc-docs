At any time you can press the HOME button to return to the Home screen. Pressing HOME again toggles between the Signal Flow view and the Performance view

### Signal Flow View

This is the main screen for editing presets, see [editing-a-preset](../working-with-presets/editing-a-preset/ "mention") for detailed instructions

1. Preset Number and Name - The small "E" at the end indicates there are unsaved edits to the preset
2. The Currently Active Snapshot Number (see [snapshots.md](../file-structure-and-terminology/snapshots.md "mention") and [working-with-snapshots.md](../working-with-presets/working-with-snapshots.md "mention"))
3. Signal Path 1 - Typically the only path we use. Paths consist of an Input Block, an Output Block, and any number of other Blocks (amps, effects, etc) in between (see [blocks.md](../file-structure-and-terminology/blocks.md "mention"))
4. Input Block - Shows which input channel is assigned to the path. Will turn <mark style="color:green;">green</mark> when a signal is present and <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> if the input is clipping.
5. The Currently Selected Block - Will have a white outline
6. Output Block - Shows where the output of a path is being sent, usually to the back panel jacks. Like the Input Block, this will turn <mark style="color:green;">green</mark> when a signal is present and <mark style="color:red;">red</mark> if the output is clipping.
7. Signal Path 2 - Rarely used by Friend's Church so far but can be used for an additional instrument, vocal mic, USB MIDI device, or to extend Path 1 to allow for more effects in series or parallel
8. Selected Block Area - Shows the Category and Name of the selected Block ("Delay" and "Harmony Delay" in the above example) and a list of editable parameters. The horizontal line across the top of this section is actually a scrollbar, indicating if there are additional parameters that can be scrolled to using the :arrow\_backward: PAGE and PAGE :arrow\_forward: Buttons
9. Parameters - Each parameter is edited by the knob directly below it

### Performance View

Use this view during a performance to easily see what each of the 8 central footswitches controls, based on which Mode you are in (see [modes.md](modes.md "mention"))
